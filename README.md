  ### Q.16 You are running an ecommerce site that is looking for imbalanced orders. An imbalanced order is one whose maximum quantity is strictly greater than the average quantity of every order (including itself). The average quantity of an order is calculated as (total quantity of all products in the order) / (number of different products in the order). The maximum quantity of an order is the highest quantity of any single product in the order. Write an SQL query to find the order_id of all imbalanced orders. Return the result table in any order.
  
   **Orders With Maximum Quantity Above Average**:
   `Company - Flipkart`

Table: OrdersDetails

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| order_id    | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| quantity    | int  |

(order_id, product_id) is the primary key for this table.
A single order is represented as multiple rows, one row for each product in the order.
Each row of this table contains the quantity ordered of the product product_id in the order order_id.

The query result format is in the following example:

OrdersDetails table:

| order_id | product_id | quantity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 1        | 1          | 12       |
| 1        | 2          | 10       |
| 1        | 3          | 15       |
| 2        | 1          | 8        |

### Q.17 A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle. However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate. Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three  sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.

   **Triangle Judgement**:
   `Company - Oracle`        

| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
 
###  Solution - 

     select *, 
           case when x+y>z and y+z>x and z+z>y then 'Yes' else 'No' end as triangle 
     from Triangle 

 For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
 | x  | y  | z  | triangle |
 |----|----|----|----------|
 | 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
 | 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

 ### Q.18 Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

###  Solution - 

     select *, 
           case when x+y>z and y+z>x and z+z>y then 'Yes' else 'No' end as triangle 
     from Triangle 

For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

| Email   |
|---------|
| a@b.com |

 ### Q.19 Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.
 
   **Marvel Cities**:

|   Population |   Number  | 


###  Solution - 

     select * 
     from CITY
     where population >100000 and countrycode = 'Marv';
